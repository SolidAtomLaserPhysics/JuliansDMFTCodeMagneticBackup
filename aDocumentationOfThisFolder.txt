This folder was used to put Georgs code into Julians code we pulled from Git (17.1.2023)
Status now: 
		It finally works

(27.1.23) again tested it and it still works but some problems with it at HLRN, but should work
run.sh runs this script with specific start values, for that it copies the hubb.andpar_bak to hubb.andpar to use it with those values, e.g. 36 processors
Then we get specific values of V and Epsilon to compare to other Code versions
for that we use symm = false (true makes no sense in magnetic field), U = 2, mu = 1, 2D SC and so on


Dont have -g to not activate degug mode and then faster
use -O3 to be faster

start it with ./run.sh
